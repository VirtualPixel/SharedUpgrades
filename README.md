# SharedUpgrades++

Share upgrades with your whole team in R.E.P.O. — without breaking the fun.

Full upgrade sharing is great, but it can make runs feel easy once the economy breaks down. SharedUpgrades++ adds a configurable chance system, so shared upgrades feel like a lucky bonus instead of a guaranteed handout. 100% for full sharing, 50% if you want it to feel earned, or anything in between.
